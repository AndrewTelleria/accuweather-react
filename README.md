# React / Accuweather

React app that uses the Accuweather API to query current conditions and a five day forecast, for a searched city. The app uses Axios http client to make AJAX calls to the API. I also used HTTPie to test the API endpoints.

I have committed my API key to make it easier for whoever wants to test the app and with the current subscription I'm allowed 50 requests per day.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
